                            <p>Years ago I (Robert) spent some time in the cupping lab with a well known coffee man, Karl Hans von Gimborn.

                            <p>I will always remember a singular moment when we were sitting at the cupping table and Karl picked up one little bean and looked me straight in the eyes. He said, “You know, everything we do, and everything we ever can do in designing and building equipment, is simply to ‘unlock’ what nature has already put into this little bean.” This same message is the ethos of Sodoi. All the skills we have, all the efforts we make, are in the service of revealing the essence of what creation has built into each unique coffee.

                            <p>From our green buyer, to roast-master, to every brewer and server, and through everyone on the Sodoi team, including our customers, we are saying to each bean we roast and each brew we serve – Come on little bean, tell the truth, open your heart, love your life, and be the delicious coffee you can be.

                                    This fame is well deserved as the region of Guatemala is ideal in every way for growing great coffee. Guatemala Antigua has a solid tradition for selective harvesting and the meticulous processing needed to produce coffee of the very highest standards.

                                <p>Actually I (Robert) will tell you this in all sincerity, one of the best brewed coffee’s I ever had was in a little coffee bar in Mexico. I know, I know, this is so far off the track of what is expected that its almost lacking credibility. Nevertheless it was so good that I just had to inquire from the proprietor just how they had come up with such a wonderful flavor.

For decades they have supported the industry with special conferences, agricultural support, and have encouraged something we might call “coffee tourism”. At it’s best Costa Rican coffee can have it all, full body, floral aroma’s, and bright acidity that can stand up to the full range of coffee roasting.

                                <p>Kenya coffee holds a special place in my heart. Nearly twenty years ago I (Robert) was fortunate enough to meet several coffee men from Nairobi and entered into the unique adventure which is the Kenya Coffee Auction.

                                    Unlike coffees from other parts of the world, Kenya coffee is sold through a nationally organized auction system. The process can be quite daunting to the uninitiated.

For years Colombia and coffee have been synonymous, helped of course by the ever-present advertising figure of Juan Valdez and his coffee sack laden donkey onto the screens of American television even at the Superbowl.
