							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Typography is the art of arranging letters and text to make the text legible and visually appealing to the reader. Text is also the primary form of expression to convey information. The purpose of the design and text information is emphasized by controlling the text's size, weight, color, and font design. When designing and selecting fonts, if designers can consider the user's age, interests, and cultural background, it will help users understand what information the design work wants to convey and how it can trigger certain emotions in the user and convey specific information.</p>
