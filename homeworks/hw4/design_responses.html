							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article taught me that it’s best to think about accessibility early in the product lifecycle – it reduces the time and money you spend trying to make your product traceable. Designers should ensure product color accessibility. When designing content such as buttons, cards or navigation elements, it is essential to check that color combinations have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 and include messages or icons that clearly indicate what is happening. </p>
