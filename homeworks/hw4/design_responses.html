							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article taught me that it’s best to think about accessibility early in the product lifecycle – it reduces the time and money you spend trying to make your product traceable. Designers should ensure product color accessibility. When designing content such as buttons, cards or navigation elements, it is essential to check that color combinations have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 and include messages or icons that clearly indicate what is happening. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color accessibility enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as people without visual impairments. Giving users the option to add texture or pattern when displaying content such as graphs or charts ensures that people with color blindness Be able to differentiate between them without having to worry about color affecting their perception of the data. Creating an accessible color system allows team members to reference it when needed so that everyone is clear on correct usage and ensuring accessibility is always a priority for your team. Clearly calling out specific color combinations within a UI kit or design system is the most effective approach. </p>
