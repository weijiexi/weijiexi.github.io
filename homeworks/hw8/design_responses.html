					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something I learned from this article is the different types of Dark Patterns, which are ways to manipulate users, such as Bait and Switch, Disguised Ads, Forced Continuity, and others. The concept of "Privacy Zuckering" refers to tricking users into publicly sharing more information about themselves than they intended. This term sheds light on the deceptive tactics used by some platforms to gather user data. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article is the discussion on possible solutions to combat Dark Patterns. It's interesting to see different perspectives on how designers can address ethical concerns in their work, from establishing codes of conduct to considering the moral implications of their designs. This leaves readers with a thought-provoking message about the responsibility of designers in shaping user experiences.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "As Campbell-Dollaghan (2017) stated, we are entering a new era where we shouldnâ€™t be using dark patterns as weapons to influence our world." </p>
					</li>
