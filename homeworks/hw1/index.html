                        I am a student at UC Berkeley, majoring in Art Practice. I am interested in painting, drawing, and photography. I am also interested in web design and development. My goal for many years was to become an interaction &amp; UX designer, a digital artist. I love creative coding and have a huge passion for the combination of art, design, and technology.
