                    <p>
                        I am a student at UC Berkeley, majoring in Art Practice. I am interested in painting, drawing, and photography. I am also interested in web design and development. My goal for many years was to become an interaction &amp; UX designer, a digital artist. I love creative coding and have a huge passion for the combination of art, design, and technology.

                    <h4>1. What is something you learned from this article?</h4>
                    <p>In Kathleen's article, I learned we should use design elements to heighten the importance of specific content to guide people's focus. We need to design some content to make them more highlighted and enjoyable and think of an app how to help people solve problems and who is the app's user.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. What was your favorite part of this article?</h4>
                    <p> This article told us that when designing an app, we should consider using specific design elements to enhance the product's user experiment and deeply consider how to develop methods to improve each component's function. We study the product from a user's viewpoint. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>3. Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool.</h4>
                    <p>  “By routinely analyzing other apps, you’ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself.”
                    </p>
                    <h4>4. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</h4>
                    <p>  I give 8. I think this article is very helpful for me to understand how to design an app and how to use design elements to guide people's focus.
