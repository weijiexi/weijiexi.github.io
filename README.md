## Web Design DeCal
The purpose of Web Design Decal is to provide students with educational resources for creating materials for the web. This includes both (1) web design -- user experiences and interfaces, graphic design, and prototyping, as well as (2) web development -- introduction to front-end engineering, simple animations, etc., both of which are for programs that are not provided by the university. We solely focus on web-related design and development, and work towards building a strong foundation in our students.
