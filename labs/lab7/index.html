<h1> Lab 07 </h1>

<h2 id="part-11-nav-bar-madness">Part 1: Fake News</h2>
<p>Your goal for this section is to tinker around on the <a href="assets/img/original_04_15.png" target=”_blank”> New York Times </a>
    website and change a few things to make it your own.</p>
<ol>
    <li>What is the link to their website where the New York Times is listing their open positions?</li>
        <p>
            <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/thenewyorktimes" target=”_blank”> https://boards.greenhouse.io/thenewyorktimes </a>            
        </p>
    <li>What font does the New York Times use for their headings?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Header: "The New York Time" </li>
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> font: is a svg image, a logo </p>
            <li>Sub Header: No Jurors Picked on First Day of Trump’s Manhattan Criminal Trial</li>
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> font-family: nyt-cheltenham, georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; </p>
            <li>Sub Header: Some of the Key Players </li>
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> font-family: 'nyt-franklin', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; </p>
            <li>Sub Header: But I’m All Grown Up With a Job of My Own</li>
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> font-family: nyt-cheltenham, georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; </p>
        </ul>
    <li>Change three of their headlines to three things that happened to you today.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Header: "The New York Time" </li>
                <p> <b>Change to:</b> Web Design DeCal </p>
            <li>Sub Header: No Jurors Picked on First Day of Trump’s Manhattan Criminal Trial</li>
                <p> <b>Change to:</b> My breakfast is toasted Chinese dumpling </p>
            <li>Sub Header: Some of the Key Players </li>
                <p> <b>Change to:</b> Todo list </p>
            <li>Sub Header: But I’m All Grown Up With a Job of My Own</li>
                <p> <b>Change to:</b> Uh Now, My final projects are mixed! </p>
        </ul>
    <li>Finally, take a screenshot of your browser and put it in your code submission. It should look something like
        this (with your own headlines, the logo should still say "The New York Times").</li>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: flex-start;">
            <img src="assets/img/changednyt.png" alt="Changed NYT Screenshot" style="width: 50%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
            <img src="assets/img/original_04_15.png" alt="Original NYT Screenshot" style="width: 50%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
        </div>

</ol>

<h2 id="part-12-flexbox-ception">Part 2: Magic Number</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In your "Inspect" panel within your browser, click into the "Console" tab and into the field where you can
        enter code.</em></li>
    <li>Define a variable called <code>x</code> and assign it any integer value you want. Enter this line of code
        into the console and press enter.</li>
    <li>Let's multiply this number by 3. Assign this to a new variable called <code>y</code>. Type this line of code
        into the console as well.</li>
    <li>Next, we will add 6 to <code>y</code>. Then, divide <code>y</code> by 3.</li>
    <li>Subtract the number <code>x</code> that you initially had from the variable <code>y</code> and assign it to
        the variable <code>magicNum</code>. Now print out this final magic number by using <code>console.log()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Define a new variable called <code>magicWord</code> and assign it the value of the string with your name
        concatenated with the magic number. Print out this string in the console as well. </li>
    <li>Finally, take a screenshot of your console with all your code and output displayed and upload it to your
        code submission.</li>
</ol>
